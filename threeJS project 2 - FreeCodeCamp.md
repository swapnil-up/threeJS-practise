# threeJS project 2 - FreeCodeCamp

This time we're making an Earth.

We start off with the boilerplate for threejs, which is a lot of the code from the last project. 
planetary pixel emporirum is a website where you can get texture maps

Now the map is used instead of color within the mesh material. typically a .jpg file. 
To instantiate it instead of writing new THREE....... we create a new texture loader.

Since the earth has a slight tilt of 23.4 degrees. We add that into our scene too. 23.4 * Math.PI /100 is the rotation of the earth
earthGroup.rotation.z = (23.4 * Math.PI) / 100;

Unlike the last tutorial, there's the use of a group here so that multiple things can be triggered simultaneously. Create one. 

We're adding stars by creating a dome of points. that's a secondary file that's imported like the orbitcontroller. 
FUCKING TOOK 2 HOURS ON THIS. The stars weren't showing up. The problem was that my far field was too small (10) instead of something like 1000. 

What Went Wrong

    Far Plane Too Close: Your far plane was set to 10. If any objects (like the stars) were positioned farther away than 10 units from the camera, they wouldn't be rendered, and you wouldn't see them.
    Star Positioning: The stars generated by getStarfield() were placed randomly within a very large range (up to Â±1000 units). Because the far plane was set to 10, any stars beyond that distance were effectively invisible, even though they existed in the scene.


We also use a directional light this time so that it mimics the sun a lil. Of course change the default set positions to your liking. All of these lights (of the sun and the cities) are added to a single group so that they can work together.

We added lights for the different cities too. While doing this we gotta turn on additive blending to make the different parts work together.
you set the position in a new by position.set(1,1,1)

 For making the city lights show up even during darkness, gotta make it a meshBasicMaterial, so that it is unaffected by any other light sources. That's why the basic material is useful. Ooh this could be a good card, paste the code then ask why the light didn't show on shadowed side. 


We also added clouds on top of this and raised the scalar just a bit instead of letting it sit flat. do that by scale.setscalar(1.004)

Finally added a lil glow to the whole earth to simulate the atmospheric glow. set scalar a lil higher. Now going to add the fresnel shader on top.

It's cool how we can move the clouds a lil faster to show how it passes over the cities across earth. 


First started off by trying to write the whole boilerplate myself, skipped some things:
1. forgot to define the scene, just started writing all the stuff within.
2. a renderer has three parts: you define, set the size then appendChild to the DOM.
3. while rendering at the end to animate, gotta include both the scene and the camera.
4. how to setup controls with orbit control too

It wasn't too bad, had to look at the docs for a bit, realize some of my own mistakes like have named camera as cam this time, but using camera regardless.
